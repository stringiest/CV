I am a Maker, recovering accountant, and full-stack developer. I have spent much of my career championing technical solutions to improve processes, whether in accountancy or social housing. I am now embarking on a new challenge as a software developer, where I can use my experience to build technical solutions myself.

## Skills

#### Problem Solving & Analytical Reasoning

I have always enjoyed solving problems, both in a personal and professional setting.  In my role as Personal Tax Senior I looked for many ways to improve aspects of the job.

- Configured and introduced a workflow system for the Personal Tax Team, to replace the shared spreadsheet which had previously been used and save time
- Researched a portal system for use by the team, demonstrated it to senior management and tested it with a sample of clients. This would replace the previous system of password-protecting each document before emailing, improving security and company image.

#### Data Design

In my previous roles I have often been the 'go to' person for creating reports, having understood instinctively how the various tables fit together.  At Makers I have enjoyed being able to develop this skill, by designing the databases myself.  

- Designed the database structure for our Airbnb clone, [Makers BNB](https://github.com/samanthagottlieb/makersbnb), in week 5 of Makers
- Built a gift list app using Ruby on Rails and PostgreSQL

## Interests

I've always loved **cycling**. I love the freedom and independence it brings. I've commuted to work by bike for many years at a time, and planned & enjoyed long distance cycling holidays with friends, including cycling from London to Paris and from Lands End to John O'Groats.

I also love **swimming**, and have been on swimming holidays, circumnavigating the Scilly Isles and island-hopping in Croatia, as well as swimming in the pool. I'm looking forward to swimming at the local lido once the pools reopen!

I also play the **piano**, and enjoy **gardening**.
