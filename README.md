## Lucy Stringer

I'm a highly numerate, optimistic problem-solver. Following a career in accountancy I was looking for a new challenge, and decided to retrain as a software developer at Makers Academy. I love the intellectual challenges of tech, and am enjoying the emphasis on continuous learning.
